    <p>
        <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown <br>
        <i>printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining <br>
        essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <u><mark>1960s</mark></u> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software <br>
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of</i> <b>Lorem Ipsum.</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't <br>
        look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. <q>All the <br>
        Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet</q>. It uses a dictionary of over 200 <br>
        Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. <cite>The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free <br>
        from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</cite></b>
